# Folder Structure Setup

Let's create the following folder structure:

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT-E2E-TESTS/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/                    # CI Config folder
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode/                    # Editor-specific settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mcp.json                # MCP server config for VS Code
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                     # Environment-specific config files
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                       # Static data and constants

â”œâ”€â”€ resources/                  # Misc test resources (e.g. images, files)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                      # All organized test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # API test specs

â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example                # Template for environment files
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                        # Template for environment files
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                  # Git ignored files and folders
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json           # Dependency lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                # Project metadata and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts        # Playwright configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Project overview and instructions
```

## Quick Check

1. In the `playwright.config.ts` file, comment out all other browsers and ensure only `chromium` is enabled.

2. Run the following command to verify everything still works:

```sh
npx playwright test --headed
```

If tests execute successfully, you're all set!

ðŸŽ¯ The target project structure is now set up. Letâ€™s keep moving forward... ðŸš€
