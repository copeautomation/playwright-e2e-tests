### 3.1. Creating a basic test

[ðŸ’¡] Playwright recognizes the following file extensions as valid test specification files:
  - `*.spec.ts`
  - `*.test.ts`

__STEPS__:

1. Create a spec file `first-test.spec.ts` under the `./demo` folder
2. Create the following code

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("Should load home page with correct title", async ({ page }) => {
    // Go to the home page
    await page.goto("https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/");

    // Assert if the title is correct
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle("CURA Healthcare Service");

    // Assert header text
    await expect(page.locator('//h1')).toHaveText('CURA Healthcare providr')
});
```
3. Run this specific test file
   
```sh
npx playwright test tests/demo/first-test.spec.ts --headed
```

[ðŸ’¡] To know more about `playwright test` command, run

```sh
npx playwright test --help
```

ðŸŽ¯ Congrats! We wrote a simple test, now let's understant each line.
