cd /path/to/your/project
```

3. **Initialize Playwright:**
```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```
- When prompted:
  - Select `TypeScript` as the language
  - Choose to install **all browsers**

4. **Verify Playwright installation:**

npx playwright --version
```
- Shows the installed Playwright version.
